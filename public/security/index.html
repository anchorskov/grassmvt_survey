      <h1>Security, Privacy, and Trust</h1>
      <p>
        We built GrassrootsMVT to gather civic input without letting spam, bots, or coordinated
        manipulation drown out real voices. We also protect privacy by collecting only what we need
        to run the platform and publish results with integrity.
      </p>
      <p>This page explains:</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>how accounts and sessions work</li>
        <li>how surveys are published and versioned</li>
        <li>how responses are stored and counted</li>
        <li>how location and address verification works, and what we store and do not store</li>
        <li>how results are displayed by tier</li>
        <li>how we audit the system</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our reporting tiers</h2>
      <p>
        We publish results in tiers so the public can see the difference between broad participation
        and higher confidence participation.
      </p>

      <h3>Tier 1: General Public, no verified address</h3>
      <p>This tier includes responses from all accounts including those that have not completed address verification.</p>

      <h3>Tier 2: General Public, verified address</h3>
      <p>This tier includes responses from accounts that completed address verification.</p>
      <p>From this tier, we offer filters so we can see results at different levels:</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>State</li>
        <li>Federal House District</li>
        <li>State House District</li>
        <li>State Senate District</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We display these filters as a dropdown so we can view the same verified address dataset at
        different jurisdiction levels. Our plan is to scale down to wards within cities and counties
        as those data become available.
      </p>

      <h2>What we store</h2>

      <h3>Account basics</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Password hash, not the password</li>
        <li>Session records to keep us logged in across page loads</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Session timeouts</h3>
      <p>We use two timeouts to keep accounts secure.</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Idle timeout ends a session after a period of inactivity.</li>
        <li>Absolute timeout ends a session after a fixed number of days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Survey integrity</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>The exact survey definition used, SurveyJS JSON</li>
        <li>Survey versions and hashes so wording changes are visible and auditable</li>
        <li>Response records with timestamps</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Response editing without duplicate counting</h4>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Each account has one counted response per survey version.</li>
        <li>Users can revise answers.</li>
        <li>Revisions update the existing response and create an audit record.</li>
        <li>The survey list shows completion date and edit status.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Jurisdiction keys for aggregation</h3>
      <p>When we verify an address, we store the jurisdiction keys needed for aggregation, for example:</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>state</li>
        <li>federal house district</li>
        <li>state house district</li>
        <li>state senate district</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We store these keys so responses can aggregate correctly across multiple sessions.</p>

      <h3>Audit trail</h3>
      <p>
        We record security relevant events so we can investigate problems and show a clear history
        of what happened.
      </p>

      <h2>What we do not store</h2>

      <h3>Passwords</h3>
      <p>We never store plaintext passwords.</p>

      <h3>Precise device location</h3>
      <p>
        If we run a home of record proximity check, we do not store your location. We store only
        outcomes and buckets, for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>pass or fail</li>
        <li>distance bucket</li>
        <li>accuracy bucket</li>
        <li>timestamp</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Verification, plain language</h2>
      <p>Verification helps us reduce manipulation without turning the platform into a surveillance system.</p>

      <h3>Address verification outcome</h3>
      <p>For verified address tiering, we focus on three things:</p>
      <ol class="info-list">
        <li>The address we use to derive districts</li>
        <li>The districts we derive from that address</li>
        <li>A verification outcome, stored as status plus audit events</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Wyoming</h3>
      <p>
        Wyoming provides candidates access to a voter file. For Wyoming, we can verify eligibility
        using that dataset and then store a salted hash that prevents one person from verifying
        multiple accounts. Candidates wishing to participate may contact me Jimmy Skovgard via email
        at skovgard2026.org.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not publish or track personally identifying information. We use the voter file data
        provided by your elected secretary of state.
      </p>

      <h3>National</h3>
      <p>
        For broader participation across the country, we use an address based jurisdiction method.
        We ask for an address, derive districts, and store only the jurisdiction keys needed for
        aggregation. We can also store an address hash for deduplication signals and for internal
        consistency checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we add a proximity check, we ask the user to verify location once at the home of record
        address. We do not store your location, latitude, or longitude.
      </p>

      <h2>Anti spam protections</h2>
      <p>We use multiple layers:</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>bot challenge on sensitive actions, signup and other high risk endpoints</li>
        <li>rate limits on abuse prone endpoints</li>
        <li>one counted response per user per survey version, unless the survey design explicitly allows updates</li>
        <li>audit events that flag suspicious patterns</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Survey transparency and versioning</h2>
      <p>We treat survey wording as a public artifact.</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>We publish surveys from JSONC source file for use on grassrootsmvt.org.</li>
        <li>Each version gets a hash.</li>
        <li>Any change to wording creates a new version and a new hash.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This means anyone can compare versions and see what changed.</p>

      <h2>Your control and consent</h2>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Participation stays optional.</li>
        <li>Verification stays optional.</li>
        <li>Verified tiers strengthen aggregation quality.</li>
        <li>We keep location checks one time and store only outcomes.</li>
        <li>You will receive an email receipt with a token which you may use to revise your answers unless the survey sunsets. Most surveys are dynamic, not all.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Security is not a static promise, it is a process. We invite feedback and we publish the
        results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a short survey to gather input on what builds trust, what feels acceptable, and
        what feels like a step too far.
