      <h1>Open source</h1>
      <p>
        Our survey infrastructure is published for public review so community members can audit how
        we collect and present feedback.
      </p>
      <h2>Scope transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Survey scope is computed from the information you share during verification. Everyone starts
        in the public scope, and more local scopes unlock only after location details are confirmed.
        We store scope context as a temporary session id rather than a public profile.
