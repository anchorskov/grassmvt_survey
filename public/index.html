      <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
      <p>This is a Grassroots Movement, of the people, for the people and by the people.</p>
      <p>Your responses are completely confidential.</p>
      <p>Participate share your voice through these surveys from verified real voices.</p>
      <p>
        This is our people's platform.  Here we transform conversation into clarity.  From city, to county, on to state, and finally the nation. Our surveys are designed to gather and aggregate the voices of the electorate, verify our participation and demand integrity from those whom we elect as our senators and representatives. These surveys are designed to provide a tool for transparency and accountability  through published receipts.  Our methods are open source and within the public domain so results stay trustworthy. In states where data are available, an extra verification layer uses publicly available voter registration data to confirm district context without publishing personal details.
